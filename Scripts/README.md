# Scripts

In this directory we have all scripts used in FCUL machine while using Slurm. This are the py files you can run directly for loading the data and obtaining the results. Note: Analyse well the scripts, you will need to change some variable, for example the "PATH_CHANGE", datasets you want to use, what type of images you using, and others.
