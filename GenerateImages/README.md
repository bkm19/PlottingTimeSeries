# Generation of images from time series data

## How to use

All of the notebooks in this folder were obtained straight from GoogleColab, and they may all be uploaded straight from there as well.
The libraries used will be in the first section of the notebook.

Run the notebook using the free GoogleColab resources to use it. The image creation can take some time, and the GoogleColab session might end abruptly. To increase the run time, run the last block in the notebook. If the runtime stops in the middle of one dataset, you can start from there using the indexing of the array.

## Parameters

In the "Functions" section you can find many different functions used and which parameters to use and modify. Although a lot of parameter combinations weren't used in the thesis, anyone is welcome to use and experiment with them.
**DO NOT FORGET**, If you want to generate box plots without outliers, you need to put the boolean "showFliers" false. In Seaborn library, outliers is the same as fliers.

## Notes

The images are saved directly in GoogleDrive. GoogleDrive has space limits and takes a while to export all images to the device. I recommend using the export data option in the GoogleProfileSettings. It is faster and zips the content. 

**Do not forget** to configure the correct path to save the images in GoogleDrive.
