# Load Images and Test Accuracy

## Notes

- Most of the notebooks in this folder are old. The most recent is ObtainResults.ipynb
- The notebook loads a zip file from GoogleDrive and iterates over it. These notebooks serve only to analyze how the model would behave.
- We used many different model parameters and Keras callback functions until we reached what we wanted. The scripts directory in this repository has the final models and scripts presented in our Thesis.
